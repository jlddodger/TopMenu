{"name":"Topmenu","tagline":"TopMenu by Aperture Logic™","body":"Welcome to **TopMenu** by Aperture Logic™.\r\n\r\nTopMenu is a functionality clone of [PowerMenu](http://www.abstractpath.com/powermenu), but designed to be compatible with Windows 7 and 64-bit systems.  TopMenu is under early development.  It may crash or cause other problems (though I currently use it every day with only rare issues), and because TopMenu runs inside your other applications a serious failure in TopMenu can bring down every application in your session.  This is a danger of using global hooks which is part of how TopMenu works.  See stock disclaimer below.\r\n\r\n## Technical preview version\r\n* [TopMenu32.msi](https://github.com/jlddodger/TopMenu/blob/master/TopMenu32.msi?raw=true)\r\n* [TopMenu64.msi](https://github.com/jlddodger/TopMenu/blob/master/TopMenu64.msi?raw=true)\r\n\r\n**Note for x64 users**: Install both files to the same folder\r\n\r\n## Instructions\r\n### Installation\r\n* Download the TopMenu Installer _(x64 users should download both)_\r\n* Install TopMenu _(x64 users must install both to the same folder)_\r\n\r\n### Startup\r\n* Run the TopMenuTray[32|64].exe that matches your system\r\n* Right-click on the tray icon and click **Load**\r\n\r\n### Shutdown\r\n* Right-click on the tray icon and click **Unload**\r\n* Right-click on the tray icon and click **Exit**\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n* TopMenu run resident in **your** applications.  This means that you can exit the tray application and the TopMenu extensions will remain available in the context menus of your programs.\r\n* Each processes' environment will be updated to indicate the status of TopMenu (TopMenu_Plugin).  This environment variable can be seen with a utility program like [PROCMON.EXE](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653)\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\n* Google Chrome is sand-boxed so while the context menu items appear none of them work\r\n* Explorer cannot be minimized to tray unless the 'Launch folder windows in a separate process' option is selected\r\n* The tray application must be launched with 'Run as administrator' if UAC enabled in order to work with elevated applications\r\n* There is delay when starting new programs before the extensions are available in the menu (Load usually can fix this)\r\n* This is brand new code so many other issues **will** exist particularly in environments other than Windows 7 64-bit\r\n\r\n## Disclaimer\r\nWe don't claim Interactive EasyFlow is good for anything if you think it is, great, but it's up to you to decide.\r\nIf Interactive EasyFlow doesn't work: tough. If you lose a million because Interactive EasyFlow messes up, it's you that's out of the million, not us.\r\nIf you don't like this disclaimer: tough. We reserve the right to do the absolute minimum provided by law, up to and including nothing.\r\nThis is basically the same disclaimer that comes with all software packages, but ours is in plain English and theirs is in legalese.\r\nWe didn't really want to include a disclaimer at all, but our lawyers insisted. We tried to ignore them, but they threatened us with the shark attack at which point we relented\r\n\r\nThanks to <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_EasyFlow>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
